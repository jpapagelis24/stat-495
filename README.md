### Goals for the course
My goals for this course are to gain a deeper knowledge about Statistics in general and use everything that I've learned so far. I'm hoping that this class will help me improve my statistical communication skills.

### Thoughts Post-Graduation
I'm not quite sure what I want to do after college, but I'm hoping to do something that is a combination of Statistics and Computer Science. I still have some time left at school, so I haven't done too much in preparation yet.

### Something Fun this Summer
This summer, I was on campus doing SURF with one of my Computer Science professors and I really enjoyed experiencing research and going deeper into a computer science topic that we only touched upon in class. I also went to Greece with my family.
