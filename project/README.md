# A Performance Comparison of Bootstrap Methods


ABSTRACT: 

This paper explores different bootstrap methods for creating confidence intervals and tests their performance against each other for different types of distributions. This paper will re-introduce the idea of bootstraps and confidence intervals, as well as the theory behind different methods of bootstrapped confidence intervals. Along with the theoretical details of each method, we will provide an example of each bootstrapped confidence interval method using a toy dataset. Then, we will run a simulation that evaluates the performance of a couple of the methods on a variety of sample sizes and types of distributions.
